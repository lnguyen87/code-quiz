# <Code-Quiz>
## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? To showcase using javascript to create text, interactive elements on the DOM, setting items user inputs to localStorage, and retrieving saved inputs from localStorage.
- What problem does it solve? Code quiz solves a problem of having to create flash cards. Instead, the user can create a quiz game to help them remember javascript. 
- What did you learn? I learned how to use javascript to: create elements, assign unique id, execute commands based on user inputs, set and get inputs from local storage. 

## Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? You can access the github code by going to https://github.com/lnguyen87/code-quiz. Once on the webpage, click the green "code" button and copy the https or ssh address. Once you have the link copied, open up a terminal such as git bash, navigate to the location you want to create a repository, then type "git clone + [paste copied link]" to download the code to your local computer.
